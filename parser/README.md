# CMPT 764 - Final Project Parser

## Code Overview

1. `partnet_parser.py`:
    * Parse the original PartNet dataset files, and save the chair parts' point cloud data for each chair in a XYZ format.
    * The saved point cloud files are split into chair arms, chair back, chair base (legs), chair seat, and other parts (e.g. cover blankets, cup holders, miscellaneous decorations).
